    <p class="appear">as someone who's a first generation Filipino</p>
    <p class="appear">with parents who immigrated in the 1990s</p>
    <p class="appear">we were having conversations about this subject</p>
    <p class="appear">the room silenced as my mom almost cried</p>
    <p class="appear">she already has a lot on her plate anyway</p>
    <p class="appear">my brother and i tried to reassure her</p>
    <p class="appear">we were relieved to be naturalized already</p>
    <p class="appear">but her heart ached for all the illegal Filipinos</p>
    <p class="appear">they all came for opportunities outside of the Philippines</p>
    <p class="appear">why would America abandon that idea for political reasons?</p>
    <p class="appear">people are desperate for these kinds of opportunities</p>
    <p class="appear">it really isn't fair to watch and do nothing</p>
    <p class="appear">I have to keep moving forward despite the political discourse</p>
    <p class="appear">I felt more grateful and lucky than ever before</p>
    <p class="appear">being here is enough for me even though the world's burning</p>
    <p class="appear">this doesn't just apply to asians but any immigrant in general</p>
    <p class="appear">it's so painful but there isn't anything we can do right now</p>
    <p class="appear">I stopped watching the news and focused on my life instead</p>
    <p class="appear">what's the point of America being called "the land of milk and honey"</p>
    <p class="appear">back when my parents both arrived here in excitement like anyone else</p>
    <p class="appear">when this happens right after the new year out of all things?</p>
    <p class="appear">we already embraced the truth but felt very bitter otherwise</p>
    <p class="appear">just stay in the present and don't worry too much about everything else</p>
